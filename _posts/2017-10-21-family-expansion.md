# Family Expansion

The family grows again. Tatu (meaning 'three' in swahili) is the name of our new cat. He's a mutt, though don't tell him that.
![Tatu's first days with the Drosey-Lees. He's not sure why we're calling him Tatu, having been Odin for as long as he can remember.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2381e62d-a66e-4361-8474-2dcac185afd0.jpg)

We think he was a good choice. Keen is not exactly a gentle cat carrier, usually focusing on the neck, but he has yet to take her eyes as trophies. Also, the vet said, "This is a good cat."
![Whenever you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation, find something to destroy. It'll take your mind off the situation and establish your dominance among those watching.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a9438cdb-c332-4baa-a810-3e0094c55693.jpg)

In case you're wondering, Pili means "second" in swahili.
